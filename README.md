# 2048 Game using Pygame

This is a simple implementation of the popular 2048 game using Pygame, a set of Python modules designed for writing video games. In this game, you combine numbered tiles on a grid to create a tile with the number 2048.

## How to Play

1. **Installation**: Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You'll also need to have Pygame installed. You can install Pygame using pip:
   pip install pygame
   
3. **Running the Game**: Run the `2048.py` file using Python. This will launch the game window.

4. **Game Controls**:
- Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to move the tiles on the board.
- Press 'X'  on the game window to quit the game.

4. **Objective**: The goal of the game is to create a tile with the number 2048 by combining tiles with the same number.

5. **Gameplay**: When two tiles with the same number touch, they merge into one tile with the sum of their numbers. After each move, a new tile appears on the board with a value of either 2 or 4. The game ends when the player achieves a tile with the number 2048, or when there are no valid moves left.

## Features

- Simple and intuitive user interface.
- Colorful graphics and animations using Pygame.
- Endless gameplay with increasing difficulty as the board fills up.

## Files

- `2048.py`: The main Python file containing the game logic and interface.
- `README.md`: This file, containing instructions and information about the game.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the dependencies required to run the game (Pygame).

## Credits

This game was created by Vedansh as a Python programming exercise using Pygame. It is based on the original 2048 game created by Gabriele Cirulli.
